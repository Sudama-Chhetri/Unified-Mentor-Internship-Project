Unified Mentor Internship Project
Hi! This repository contains the work I completed as part of my internship with Unified Mentor.

📌 Project Overview
During the internship, I worked on two main datasets and applied data analysis techniques using Python and SQL:

1. Daily Household Transactions
Cleaned and processed a real-world transaction dataset.

Performed exploratory data analysis using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

Identified trends, spending patterns, and categorized expenses to draw actionable insights.

2. Electric Vehicle Sales Analysis
Analyzed EV sales data using Python and SQL.

Wrote SQL queries to extract meaningful metrics and sales patterns from the database.

Visualized insights to better understand the growth and adoption of electric vehicles.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

SQL

Jupyter Notebook

📂 Folder Structure
