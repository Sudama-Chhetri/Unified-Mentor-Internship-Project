-- MySQL helped uncover trends in electric vehicle adoption across Indian states.
-- Year-over-year growth and regional differences were analyzed in detail.
-- Using SQL queries, we extracted top-performing and underperforming states, calculated growth rates, and prepared data for visualizations.
-- This analysis enhanced my SQL skills in real-world data processing and reporting.
